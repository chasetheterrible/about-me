    <h2 id="spiff">Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
      Growing up I have had many hobbies, however these are some of my most
      favorite. I love to play video games, especially FPS games like halo and
      call of duty, as well as games like super smash bros, and legend of zelda.
      Other than video games I love to read and write fantasy and Sci-fi books.
      Other than my nerdy side I love to go shooting, cooke, eat, go water
      skiing and sleeping.

      I was born in Honolulu Hawaii in 2001 along with my twin sister Allyson,
      luckily I am the oldest child by ten minutes. Other than my twin sister I
      have 3 other sister. Loryn who is serving in Trujillo Peru, Hannah who is
      a freshman at UVU and Sophie who is a freshman in Highschool. My parents
      both served in Russia and that is how they met. My dad served in the Army
      for about 23 ish years so I moved around a lot. We lived in Hawaii,
      Georgia, North Carolina 2x, California, New York, Kansa, Colorado and now
